1. Create a folder named after the page being created. 
In the created folder always start with an 'index.php' file
For example: to create a 'home' page.
Goto views folder and create a folder called home
Inside the folder create an index.php file
Note: This structure allows you to create subsections for the created page.

For Example: for the 'home' page you created. You can create a corresponding controller
in the controllers folder called 'Home.php'
Note: Don't forget to edit the Name of the class to the appropriate controller Name
